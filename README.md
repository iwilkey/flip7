# Flip 7 Console Web Applet

## Overview

Flip 7 Console is a small, self-contained, browser-based scorekeeping utility for the card game “Flip 7”.  
It is intentionally designed as a console-style application with minimal user interface elements, favoring clarity and reliability over visual complexity.

The application runs entirely in a single HTML file and requires only a modern web browser. No server, build step, or external dependencies are needed.

## Purpose and Scope

My friends, family, and I enjoy playing the game Flip 7, but keeping score manually became cumbersome.  

The purpose of this project is simply to make scorekeeping easier. It tracks game state and assumes that players are following the rules of the game, including the proper use of special cards. This tool is intended only for final score entry and does not enforce gameplay rules.

This project is not intended to be a full-featured product, commercial offering, or long-term maintained application.

This project was developed without the use of AI-assisted tooling as an exercise to evaluate how quickly a functional utility could be created from scratch.

Development time for the initial implementation was approximately **30 minutes**.

As such, the code prioritizes straightforward behavior and portability rather than extensibility or future enhancements.

## Maintenance Policy

This software is provided **as-is**.

There are no plans for:
- Ongoing maintenance
- Feature additions
- Bug fixes
- Compatibility guarantees beyond modern browsers

Users are welcome to fork, modify, or extend the software under the terms of the license.

## Technical Notes

- Single-file HTML application
- No external libraries or frameworks
